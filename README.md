* Add required columns to data.csv file (e.g. email, subject, etc.)
* Add optional columns to data.csv file (e.g. cc/bcc, from, etc.)
* Add functionality for using other SMTP methods of sending email (other than just Gmail)
* Add how-to section on if Gmail user is utilizing 2fa (generating and using app password, etc.)
* Add how-to section on using template.txt properly
* Add multiple examples with data files (towards the completion of the first version)
